# midi-to-edp-link

This is a small Arduino sketch that converts MIDI (serial) data to EDP Link (parallel) data.

"EDP Link" was a pre-MIDI messahes format developed by electronic musical instrument developer Electronic Dream Plant
for communicating note-pitch and note-on/off information between their products (Wasp, Gnat, Spider etc).

I wrote this sletch to control my Wasp *clone* (Jasper) via MIDI, so I can't guarantee this solution will work with genuine EDP devices.
